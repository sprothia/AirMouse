## üî∂ A computer vision project that controls your mouse using your hands. 

# Introduction
### Airmouse is an AI project built with Python and many libraries/frameworks such as Mediapipe, OpenCV, numpy, and more. Using hand recognition, you can control many actions that your computers mouse performs such as clicking and scrolling.
   * Hold up certain fingers to control different parts of your mouse such as simple navigation or left-clicking
   * Built a simple static website using HTMl, CSS and Flask that allows users to learn how to control their mouse with their fingers
